        <h2> Space </h2>
        <p>Space is the area beyond the upper limits of Earth's atmosphere. It is where all of the asteroids, comets,<a href="Planets.html"> Planets</a> ,<a href="Stars.html"> Stars</a> , solar systems and<a href="Galaxies.html"> galaxies </a> in our universe are found.<br/>
            Space is a vacuum, meaning it contains almost nothing,but it is not completely empty 
            There is so much about space, our solar system, and the galaxies that we still don't know!<br/>
            Space is vast. With billions of galaxies and stars, and planets in our own solar system yet to be fully explored or understood, scientists' knowledge of space is always evolving.
            There are, however, some really cool things we know about space right now!<br/>  We've compiled a list of what we think are ten stellar facts that we hope you'll think are out of this world! <br/></p>
            <h4>6 Crazy Facts You Didn't Know About Space : </h4>
            <ol>
                <li>SPACE IS COMPLETELY SILENT</li>
                <p>There is no atmosphere in space, which means that sound has no medium or way to travel to be<br/> heard. </p>
                <li>THE HOTTEST PLANET IN OUR SOLAR SYSTEM IS 450° C.</li>
                <p>Venus is the hottest planet in the solar system and has an average surface temperature of around 450° C. Did you know that Venus isn't the closest planet to the sun?  That is Mercury.<br/>  You would think that Mercury would then be the hottest, but Mercury has no atmosphere (which regulates temperature),<br/> resulting in big fluctuations</p>
                <li>A FULL NASA SPACE SUIT COSTS $12,000,000.</li>
                <p>While the entire suit costs a cool $12m, 70% of that cost is for the backpack and control module.<br/> However, the space suits that NASA uses were built in 1974.  If these were priced by today's pricing,<br/> they would cost an estimated 150 million dollars! </p>
                <li>ONE MILLION EARTHS CAN FIT INSIDE THE SUN</li>
                <p>The Sun is large enough that approximately 1.3 million Earths could fit inside (if squashed in) or<br/> if the Earths retained their spherical shape then 960,000 would fit. <br/>But can you visualise that number of Earths? </p>
                <li>ONE DAY ON VENUS IS LONGER THAN ONE YEAR.</li>
                <p>Venus has a slow axis rotation which takes 243 Earth days to complete its day.<br/> The orbit of Venus around the Sun is 225 Earth days,<br/> making a year on Venus 18 days less than a day on Venus.</p>
                <li>THERE IS A PLANET MADE OF DIAMONDS</li>
                <p>There is a planet made of diamonds twice the size of earth The "super earth," aka 55 Cancri e, <br/>is most likely covered in graphite and diamond.  Paying a visit to that planet would probably pay for<br/> the $12 million dollar space suit needed to get there!</p>
